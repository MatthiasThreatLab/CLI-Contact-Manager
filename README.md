### Step 1 — [Date]  
**Objective:**  
What are you trying to do today?

**What I Did:**  
- 

**Challenges:**  
- Understand how excatly fgets() reads a file, what if the the current line is bigger than the buffer, will I lose information? Probably
- usage of strtok, to properly read through each line of the database
- buffer overflow when using strncat()
- wanted to use regex to valid user input but there is no cross-platform library to do so, so I had to do it manually.
